# Lightweight Scheduler
This is the project based on the [OAI_5g](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g) develop branch.

## What is Lightweight Scheduler?
We propsed a new scheme to schedule the UL UEs within adaptive resource allocation.
Which might devide the UEs into 2 types:
1. Contention-based UL UE group,
2. Contention-free UL UE group.
